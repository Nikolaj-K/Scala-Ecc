This is a library for ECDSA signing, written completely in Scala.
Only extra lib used is Base64 encoding, written by Robert Harder in Java.

Tested to be compatible with sjclecc ECC library for javascript.

Does NOT use native encryption Java interface, which are forbidden in some place (like Google App).

Works about 30% faster than Bouncy Castle ECDSA implemention in Java.

I'm not a specialist in cryptography (or Scala), so probably I messed in some places. But testing so far showed it works as it should.
